## Intro
This repo aims to showcase a simple UI5 freestyle application that can be deployed to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry Environment with:
- Managed approuter setup
- Standalone approuter setup
- Hybrid setup

A full explanation can be found in this [SAP Community blog post](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/11/01/build-and-deploy-ui5-freestyle-applications-to-sap-btp-cloud-foundry-environment/).

## Requirements
- Access to a SAP BTP subaccount (trial is sufficient)
- Cloud foundry environment provisioned
- Launchpad, Workzone, or comparable subscription with managed approuter functionality
- Quota for the HTML5 Application Repository Service
- Developer-Access to a CF Space
- SAP Business Application Studio Subscription or comparable local IDE like VSCode
- CF CLI & Node available locally on your machine or in BAS dev space

## Build Steps
Run the mbt build command with either of the mta.yaml files either directly or via the npm scripts in the root package.json:
- mbt build -p=cf -s=./_build_standalone -t=../mta_archives
- mbt build -p=cf -s=./_build_managed -t=../mta_archives

More info: https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/usage/

### Standalone mta
- This will generate an mtar that includes a standalone approuter that will be deployed together with the html5 module
- This way you have full control of your approuter

### Managed mta
- This will generate an mtar which will leverage the managed approuter for running after deployment
- This will only work if you have subscribed to a service that includes the managed approuter functionality (launchpad/portal/workzone)

## Deploy Steps
- cf login (in your preferred btp cf space)
- cf deploy ./mta_archives/ui5-standalone_1.0.0.mtar -f
- cf deploy ./mta_archives/ui5-managed_1.0.0.mtar -f

In case of undeploy, you can undeploy the mta projects completely using:
- cf undeploy ui5-standalone --delete-services --delete-service-keys
- cf undeploy ui5-managed --delete-services --delete-service-keys

## After Deployment
### Verify service instances and application
Make sure that all service instances and the cf application for the standalone scenario have been deployed successfully

### Verify html5 app content in html5 application repository
Make sure that the html5 module content has been uploaded successfully in the html5 app repo host service instance
- cf html5-list & cf html5-info

### Authorize
- map the generated user role templates to a role collection and assign it to your endusers

### Execute
run the app either via
- the custom route of the approuter (standalone) 
- the html5 applications tab on the left (managed - requires a a managed approuter e.g. from launchpad service)

## Further Topics
### Testing the app within BAS
- Navigate to the html5module folder and execute npm run start
- The ui5.yaml is used to proxy the requests via pathmapping (substitutes the xs-app files)
- (Needs to be maintained on same subaccount as BAS instance - see comments in ui5.yaml)
